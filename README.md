# audio-mode

An attempt to make a major mode for audio, like `image-mode`.

When I want to open an audio file in Dired, I often end up opening eshell and playing the file with mpv. This mode was an attempt to address that.

I ultimately gave up and abandoned this, with the [last commit](https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/audio-mode/commit/1f65b3c22821e5a49e563c8045a37a1cbef88e23) being in April 2020.

Years later, now Xenodium has made [ready-player](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player), which is what I hoped to do with this attempt and then some.
